                    Thanks to my performance in the final examinations of June 2018, I received an excellence scholarship from the Haitian government, recognizing me as a National Laureate. This generous scholarship paved the way for my higher education journey and enabled me to enroll in Civil Engineering at Quisqueya University.

                    In 2019, I left my hometown for the capital with a clear goal: to receive the necessary training for becoming a skilled Civil Engineer and a responsible citizen for my nation. However, this new environment introduced me to programming and algorithmic courses, unveiling the exciting world of Computer Science. This unexpected discovery was like a revelation, even though my formal studies were in Civil Engineering.<br>
                    Determined to delve deeper into this newfound passion while pursuing my Civil Engineering degree, I saw the potential to enhance problem-solving and efficiency in my chosen field. Unfortunately, by 2022, my homeland faced instability, prompting my decision to leave for Taiwan. This move was driven by the desire to wholeheartedly focus on Computer Science, seizing the opportunity to pursue my passion without constraints.

                    Between October 2022 and August 2023, I immersed myself in the study of the Chinese language, which proved to be an incredibly fascinating journey. Through the language center's guidance, I achieved a proficient B1-level, allowing me to comfortably engage in daily conversations and interact with native speakers. This experience has enriched my life in more ways than one.
