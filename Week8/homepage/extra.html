                    Programming is the last but certainly not the least of my hobbies. Every day, I spend more than eight hours learning
                    new things. Should I even call this a hobby? I'm not sure if it's enough to label it that way. In 2020, when I started
                    to learn Python, I immediately fell in love with the process of creating something from my mind and defining each step of
                    the process precisely. <br><br>Programming has become an art for me. Discovering new, more efficient ways to implement
                    solutions for problems or tasks has deepened my interest in computer science. This interest ultimately led me to change
                    my major from civil engineering to Computer Science. I believe this field is ever-changing, which is why I don't anticipate
                    getting bored with it anytime soon.

                    I think the world is a beautiful place, and the idea of spending all of my time in one place hurts my soul.
                    There is so much I haven't seen yet on this earth; that is why one of my favorite hobbies is sightseeing. The
                    simple fact of discovering new places and meeting new people makes me happy to be alive. In the future, I hope I
                    can have a lot of stories to tell my kids about my adventures.

                    Some people say that we eat in order to live, not the inverse, but sometimes the delicacy that I create while
                    mixing ingredients makes me wonder about that. The simple act of creating something delicious that brings you
                    happiness just by eating it—isn't that also a joy of life? Most of the time, I try to prepare my meals by myself
                    and be creative about it. Additionally, I like to taste new flavors whenever I can. I think this adds a little bit
                    more color to my life and is therefore also my hobby.

                    <em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>, otherwise a healthy mind in a healthy body. I believe this is a great principle for a
                    person's well-being and an efficient way to stay balanced. In recent years, my own discovery of the benefits of fitness and
                    exercise has been very impactful. Being more focused on my work, experiencing less stress than before, and even getting sick
                    less often—these are all positive outcomes from daily exercise.<br><br>

                    I usually go jogging to become more resilient, play basketball to improve my focus and become addicted to self-improvement,
                    and sometimes I lift weights to become accustomed to pain. I believe I have gained a well-balanced and healthier life from
                    these activities; therefore, it is not just a hobby but a way of life.
